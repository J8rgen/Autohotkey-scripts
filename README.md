Autohotkey scripts
Collection of my autohotkey scripts.


## SaveScreenshots.ahk

Save Win + Shift + S screenshots to desktop. Used it alot before I found an application called "Paste Into File". Still thought that this might be useful to some.
I also later found out that the images are saved into C:\Users\Your-username\AppData\Local\Packages\MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS_cw5n1h2txyewy\TempState\ScreenClip 

- Uses the Snipping Tool to take a screenshot.
- Pastes the screenshot into Microsoft Paint.
- Saves the screenshot with an incrementing filename.

Edit the script to set your desired screenshot save path.
It is recommended to change the Image Properties in MS Paint to something small like 10x10 to avoid white borders in your screenshots.

## Youtube skip.ahk

I use this for youtube tutorials, so i dont need to switch between tabs to rewind/fast forward 5 seconds

Uses YouTube Music Hotkeys addon.
