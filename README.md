Made this AutoHotkey script a while back to save Win + Shift + S screenshots to desktop. Used it alot before I found an application called "Paste Into File". Still thought that this might be useful to some.

## Features

- Uses the Snipping Tool to take a screenshot.
- Pastes the screenshot into Microsoft Paint.
- Saves the screenshot with an incrementing filename.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Edit the script to set your desired screenshot save path.
4. It is recommended to change the Image Properties in MS Paint to something small like 10x10 to avoid white borders in your screenshots.

## Usage

- Run the script
- Press `Win + Shift + S` to take a screenshot.
- The screenshot will be saved to the specified directory with an incrementing filename.


I also later found out that the images are saved into C:\Users\Your-username\AppData\Local\Packages\MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS_cw5n1h2txyewy\TempState\ScreenClip
